By using the OMDB API, I created a simplistic movie database website, allowing users to quickly search for a desired movie or TV show. It also displays various things such as release year, IMDB rating and more, and when loading it displays skeleton loading areas to let users know that their movie request is loading. In addition, the website features a secondary page which shows movie information in more detail once their desired movie is clicked.
